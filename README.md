readability-extract
===================

The goal of this library is to provide a function that will extract article text from a webpage. It is based on the [Readability bookmarklet](https://code.google.com/p/arc90labs-readability/) and the [Kerrick/readability-js](https://github.com/Kerrick/readability-js) repository.

Overview of changes
-------------------
The Readability bookmarklet extracts article text from the current webpage, but it also modifies the current page to display article in an easy to read fashion. This fork's contribution is to pull that article extracting functionality out into a function that leaves the page unchanged.
